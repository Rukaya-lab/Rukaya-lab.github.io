## Data Analaysis and Exploration Projects

### [Investigate a Dataset: No Show Appointment](https://github.com/Rukaya-lab/Project-/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

- Project: Medical Appointment No Shows. Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?
- Context: A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?
- Dataset: This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- Exploration:
  - People who do not have Diabetes have a average show up rate of 80% while people with Diabetes have a average show up rate of 82%.
  - There are significant number of female records as compared to the male records.
  - In teenagers, less than 70% of those with hypertension tend to show up, which is less than average of all across the ages.
  - Possible Limitations could include the geography of the hospitals and residences of the patients and how there could be possible commuting problems that could affect show up rate.

### [Wrangle and Analyze Data: We Rate Dogs](https://github.com/Rukaya-lab/Project-/blob/main/WeRateDogs/wrangle_act.ipynb)

- Project: Wrangle data from different sources and Analyze.
  WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that posts and rates pictures of dogs. 
- Dataset:
Gathring the dataset from different data sources including:
  - A csv data file directly from archived data 
  - Using the Requests library to download the tweet image prediction
  - Using the Tweepy library to query additional data via the Twitter API
- Task:
  - detecting and cleaning quality issues and tidiness issue with the data.
    - There are significant number of missing values in the twitter archive dataset
    - The name column has a lot of duplicated values and some names are None
    - Tweet ids are currently in integer but they should be strings
    - The timestamp is in integer format rather than datetime
    - The dog stages are in separate columns but they should be in one
    - The three dataset have tweet id in common, hence could be combined
 - Exploration:
    - The most common dog breed is the Labrador Retriever.
    - The highest number of retweet is recorded in 2016
    - The most common name is Charlie followed by Cooper, Lucy and Oliver with the same count
