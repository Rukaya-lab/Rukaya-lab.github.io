## Data Analaysis and Exploration Projects

### [Investigate a Dataset: No Show Appointment](https://github.com/Rukaya-lab/Project-/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

- Project: Medical Appointment No Shows. Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?
- Context: A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?
- Dataset: This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
- Exploration:
  - People who do not have Diabetes have a average show up rate of 80% while people with Diabetes have a average show up rate of 82%.
  - There are significant number of female records as compared to the male records.
  - In teenagers, less than 70% of those with hypertension tend to show up, which is less than average of all across the ages.
  - Possible Limitations could include the geography of the hospitals and residences of the patients and how there could be possible commuting problems that could affect show up rate.
