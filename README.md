### [Investigate a Dataset: No Show Appointment](https://github.com/Rukaya-lab/Project-/blob/main/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

- Project: Medical Appointment No Shows. Why do 30% of patients miss their scheduled appointments?
- Context: A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?
- Dataset: This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
